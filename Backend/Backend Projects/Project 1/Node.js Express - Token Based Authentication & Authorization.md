In this project, we’re gonna build a Node.js Express Rest API example that supports Token Based Authentication with JWT ([JSONWebToken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken)). You’ll know:

- Appropriate Flow for User Signup & User Login with JWT Authentication.
- Node.js Express Architecture with CORS, Authentication & Authorization middlewares & Sequelize.
- How to configure Express routes to work with JWT.
- How to define Data Models and association for Authentication and Authorization.
- Way to use Sequelize to interact with MySQL Database.
